# 2-bit ALU Microcontroller Using Logic Gates

**Authors:** Umesh Puri  

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a simplified 2-bit microcontroller built entirely using basic logic gate ICs and discrete components. The main goal was to illustrate the fundamental principles of CPU architecture — particularly the fetch–decode–execute cycle — in a tangible hardware model.

The microcontroller includes essential components such as logic gates, registers, SRAM, PROM, ALU, decoders, buffers, and a clock unit. It implements a small set of instructions (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, LOAD, STORE, STORE IMMEDIATE, NOP, HALT) using a Load–Store architecture.

## Features
- Complete 2-bit CPU implemented with discrete logic ICs  
- Supports arithmetic, logic, and memory instructions  
- Demonstrates fetch–decode–execute cycle  
- Clock-driven operation using NE555 timer  
- Instruction execution verified via LEDs and simulation  

## Components
- 74HLS08N (AND), 74LS86AN (XOR), 74LS32DC (OR)  
- 74xx373 (latches/registers)  
- 74LS238 (decoder)  
- 74S188 (PROM)  
- SN74LS243N and SN74LS126 (buffers)  
- 74LS191 (program counter)  
- NE555 timer (clock source)
